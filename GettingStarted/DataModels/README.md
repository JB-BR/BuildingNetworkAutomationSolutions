# Data Model
Generate a configuration for a site-to-site VPN on a Juniper SRX device.

## Data Input
* service.yaml : Human-intended file, can be edited by a network operator
* service.json : Same structure as in service.yaml, but generated by a program, for example by using the service_ipsec_formular.xlsx
* nodes.yaml : Node-specific parameters for the IPSEC service, like the tunnel interface number and external interface number. The customer can chose thos and they must be specified by an operator or (even better) automatically generated by allocating the next free tunnel interface and the default internet-facing interface.
* network.yaml: Not used at the moment
* fabric.yaml: Not used at the moment

## Configuration template
* s2s_vpn_template_for_juniper_srx.j2: The configuration template for an IPSEC Service. A few business choices have already been made: security zone design, standard security policies, naming convention.

## Playbook
* pb.generate.vpn.config.yaml: Puts everything together and generates a "ready-to-use" configuration extract for a Juniper SRX. It can either use "service.yaml" or "service.json".
