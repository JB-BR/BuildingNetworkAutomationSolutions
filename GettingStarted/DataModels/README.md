# Data Model
Generate a configuration for a site-to-site VPN on a Juniper SRX device.

## Data Input
* service.yaml : Human-intended file, can be edited by a network operator
* service.json : Same structure as in service.yaml, but generated by a program, for example by using the service_ipsec_formular.xlsx
* nodes.yaml : Node-specific parameters out of the customer scope: the tunnel interface number and external interface number on the provider Juniper SRX. An operator or (even better) a programm must provide the next available tunnel number and an appropriate internet-facing interface.
* network.yaml: Not used at the moment
* fabric.yaml: Not used at the moment

## Configuration template
* s2s_vpn_template_for_juniper_srx.j2: The configuration template for an IPSEC Service. A few business choices have already been made: security zone design, standard security policies, naming convention.

## Playbook
* pb.generate.vpn.config.yaml: Puts everything together and generates a "ready-to-use" piece of configuration for a Juniper SRX. It can either use "service.yaml" or "service.json" as they have the same structure.
